Gathering nodes, locations, contents, and +2 Yield / +5 Attempts
bonuses are all static. Other bonuses (+1 Yield) are random (I think).

There are 192 gathering nodes in the Diadem, in 24 groups of 8 nodes
each.

The 24 groups are broken into 4 tracks of 6 groups each.

Only one node from each group is visible at a time. When you enter
Diadem, node 1 from each group is visible. After clearing that node,
node 2 appears, and so on. After clearing node 8, node 1 becomes
available again.

For MIN nodes, the next numbered node will be clockwise around the
zone. For BTN, the nodes are numbered counterclockwise
(anticlockwise).

After gathering node 8 in a group, if you keep moving in the direction
you were going, you will be moving to the next group. Or you can go
back to the beginning of the group you just finished since node 1 will
be back up.

Node 7 always has +2 yield with high stat requirement. On the inner
tracks, the stat requirement is Perception. On the outer tracks it's
Gathering.

Node 8 always has +5 attempts with high GP requirement. This means if
you're doing the inner and outer tracks in parallel and you want to
use KY2/BH2 on both, you will need to be able to burst spend 1000 GP.

The mats listed all belong to the "Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders'"
family. If you want one of the lower tier mats, figure out which one
of these it appears with.
